## Install

### MacOS - Homebrew

After installed [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on your system, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
brew install glue
```

### Linux, Windows, MacOS - Build from source

1. Clone this repository
2. Install Rust
3. Build sources with `cargo build --release`

## Usage

### Simple request

To execute a request chain with glue you can simply pass it this way:

```bash
glue <REQUEST>
```

The simplest request you can do with glue is using simply the method and the url:

```bash
glue "get https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all"
```

### JSON result selector

If the response is of type JSON, you can add a jsonpath selector to the request with the char `^`. Glue will only return the desired value from the response. This applies also for [Nested requests](#nested-requests).

```bash
glue "get https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all^$.message.terrier"

# OUTPUT:
# > [GET] https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all
# 
# 
# [
#   [
#     "american",
#     "australian",
#     "bedlington",
#     "border",
#     "cairn",
#     "dandie",
#     "fox",
#     "irish",
#     "kerryblue",
#     "lakeland",
#     "norfolk",
#     "norwich",
#     "patterdale",
#     "russell",
#     "scottish",
#     "sealyham",
#     "silky",
#     "tibetan",
#     "toy",
#     "welsh",
#     "westhighland",
#     "wheaten",
#     "yorkshire"
#   ]
# ]
```

### Body attributes

You can use the char `~` to add body attributes to the request:

```bash
glue "post https://example.com/user/add~username=admin"
# or
glue "post https://example.com/user/add ~username=admin"

# glue will send a body of type JSON 
# with a key "username" with value "admin"
```

### Nested requests

One of the most useful features of glue is the request nesting. 

You can reuse response values (total or partial) from a request to build another request. 

Glue supports infinite nesting and will build a dependency tree, divide it in layers and execute each layer on parallel for the maximum time optimization.

You can use request nesting delimiting the desired nested request with `{}`:

```bash
glue "get api.com/users/{ get api.com/me^$.user.id }/"

# glue will execute this two requests:

#Â 1. api.com/me - and will select user.id from the response (eg. 12345)

# 2. api.com/users/12345/
```

### Run file

You can also create a file with request to run, and pass the file path to glue with flag `-f` to execute it. You can try with one of the sample requests in `examples` folder:

```bash
glue -f examples/sample-request.glue
```
