## Getting started
### Install & Update

At the moment, you can install or update glue for your system by building it from source. It has been done quite easy by the script `install.sh`.

All build dependencies (including Rust) will be deleted right after the installation automatically if Rust wasn't already on your system.

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikesposito/glue
```

2. Go to glue root directory
```bash
cd glue
```

3. Add execute permission and run install.sh
```bash
chmod +x ./install.sh && ./install.sh
```

### Usage

To start an interactive glue shell, simply run:

```bash
glue
```

alternatively, you can also execute a request directly:

```bash
glue <REQUEST>
```

The simplest request you can do with glue is using just the method and the url:

```bash
glue 'get https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all'
# or in glue shell:
get https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all
```

## Syntax

### Overview

The main gluescipt request syntax is the following:

```bash
[METHOD] [URL] [OPERATORS]
```

### Methods available

| Glue Keyword | Description |
|---|---|
| `get` | Executes a GET http call |
| `post` | Executes a POST http call |
| `patch` | Executes a PATCH http call |
| `put` | Executes a PUT http call |
| `delete` | Executes a DELETE http call |
| `req` | Reuses a saved request response from memory |

### Operators available

Operators allow to execute operations on requests (body, headers params, nesting), on responses (selectors, variables)

| Operation | Syntax | Example |
|---|---|---|
| [JSON Result Selector](#json-result-selector) | **^**`selector` | `^$.message` |
| [Body attribute](#body-attributes) | **~**`key`**=**`value` | `~username=admin` |
| [Body attribute quoted](#body-attributes) | **~**`key`**="**`value`**"** | `~fullname="John Doe"` |
| [Raw JSON body](#raw-json-body) | **~#-**`json`**-#** | `~#-{"username": "admin"}-#` |
| [Header attribute](#headers) | **\***`key`**=**`value` | `*authorization=xxx` |
| [Header attribute quoted](#headers) | **\***`key`**="**`value`**"** | `*authorization="Bearer xxx"` |
| [Nested request](#nested-requests) | **{** `nested_request` **}** | `get api.com/users/{get api.com/me}` |
| [Save response in var](#save-response-in-variable) | **>**`var` | `>login_request` |

### JSON result selector

If the response is of type JSON, you can add a jsonpath selector to the request with the char `^`. Glue will only return the desired value from the response. This applies also for [Nested requests](#nested-requests).

```bash
get https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all^$.message.terrier

# OUTPUT:
# > [GET] https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all
# 
# 
# [
#   [
#     "american",
#     "australian",
#     "bedlington",
#     "border",
#     "cairn",
#     "dandie",
#     "fox",
#     "irish",
#     "kerryblue",
#     "lakeland",
#     "norfolk",
#     "norwich",
#     "patterdale",
#     "russell",
#     "scottish",
#     "sealyham",
#     "silky",
#     "tibetan",
#     "toy",
#     "welsh",
#     "westhighland",
#     "wheaten",
#     "yorkshire"
#   ]
# ]
```

### Body attributes

You can use the char `~` to add body attributes to the request:

```bash
post https://example.com/user/add ~username=admin
# or
post https://example.com/user/add~username=admin

# glue will send a body of type JSON 
# with a key "username" with value "admin"
```

#### **Raw JSON Body**

Raw JSON values can also be used between `~#-JSON-` instead of single attributes:

```bash
post https://example.com/users ~#-{ "name": "John" }-#
# or 
post https://example.com/users~#-{ "name": "John" }-#
```

#### **Note**
Body attributes can take their value from another request's response by using [nested requests](#nested-requests) feature.

### Headers

You can use the char `*` to set headers to the request:

```bash
post https://example.com/user/add*authorization=6a75d4d7-84c3
# or
post https://example.com/user/add *authorization=6a75d4d7-84c3

# glue will set Authorization header
# to value "6a75d4d7-84c3"
```

Quotes can also be use to escape special glue chars or spaces in attributes:

```bash
post https://example.com/user/add*authorization="Bearer 6a75d4d7-84c3"
```

#### **Note**
Headers can take their value from another request's response by using [nested requests](#nested-requests) feature.

### Nested requests

One of the most useful features of glue is the request nesting. 

You can reuse response values (total or partial) from a request to build another request. 

Glue supports infinite nesting and will build a dependency tree, divide it in layers and execute each layer on parallel for the maximum time optimization.

You can use request nesting delimiting the desired nested request with `{}`:

```bash
get api.com/users/{ get api.com/me^$.user.id }/

# glue will execute this two requests:

#Â 1. api.com/me - and will select user.id from the response (eg. 12345)

# 2. api.com/users/12345/
```

Request can also be nested inside body or headers parameters:

```bash
get api.com/me *authorization={get api.com/login^$.access_token}/
```

### Run file

You can also create a file with request to run, and pass the file path to glue with flag `-f` to execute it. You can try with one of the sample requests in `examples` folder:

```bash
glue -f examples/sample-request.glue
```

### Save response in variable

You can save a request response in a temporary variable with a name of your choice with the char `>`, to reuse it without executing the call again.

```bash
get https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all >test_req
```

to use the saved response:

```bash
req test_req
```

You can also use a selector on the saved response with `^`:

```bash
req test_req^$.message.terrier
```

**Note**: Variables are available only in the same glueshell session and dropped at the end of it.
